# 🕯️ About Me

Hi. I’m **Taji Amine**.  
I build systems, worlds, and tools — usually in silence, usually with intent.

Full-stack developer by training.  
Indie game developer by obsession.  
IoT and data when the problem demands it.

---

## 🧩 What I Do

I work across **code, logic, and narrative**.

Some days that means designing scalable web systems.  
Other days it means building tension, puzzles, and atmosphere inside a game engine.

I’m drawn to **psychological horror, mystery, investigation**, and systems that reveal themselves slowly.

## 🕳️ Current Work

- **MindCage**  
  A psychological, narrative-driven game built in **Unreal Engine 5**  
  Isolation, survival, environmental storytelling, and mental pressure  
  Developed under **Final Signal Studio**

- **Full-Stack Applications**  
  React + Node.js + SQL Server  
  Real-world logic, not tutorials

- **IoT Experiments**  
  Raspberry Pi systems using RFID and low-level GPIO scripting  
  Physical input meets software decisions

- **Data & Analysis**  
  Advanced Excel, Power BI, Python, QlikView  
  Data as a narrative, not just numbers
